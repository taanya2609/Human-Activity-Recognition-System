# Human-Activity-Recognition-System
This project uses simulated sensor data to classify six human activities with a CNN model. Activities include Squats, Jumping Jacks, Push-ups, Walking, Sitting, and Sleeping. It achieves high accuracy and includes voice feedback using gTTS, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in Human Activity Recognition.
